# Architecture Pivot Summary - Version 1.2

**Date**: October 31, 2025  
**Status**: Major architectural change  
**Impact**: High - affects data ingestion, verification, and UI

---

## üéØ Why We Pivoted

### Original Approach (v1.0-1.1)

- Single upstream API (Crunchbase ‚Üí OpenVC)
- Assumed data correctness
- AI for scoring/enrichment only
- Cost: **$329-879/month** (still expensive)

### Problems Identified

1. **OpenVC**: No API + NC/ND licensing = not suitable for commercial use
2. **Crunchbase**: $35,000/year API subscription = too expensive for client
3. **Bottleneck**: Data acquisition cost, not AI capabilities

---

## üí° New Approach (v1.2)

### Multi-Source + AI Verification + Human-in-the-Loop

**Core Philosophy**: Build an intelligent curation system that:

- Uses FREE public sources
- Validates data quality with AI
- Involves humans for uncertain cases
- Client controls their own data

### Data Sources (All Free/Low-Cost)

1. **Public investor lists**
   - OpenVC "list of lists"
   - NYC angel directories
   - Alumni/network pages
2. **Firm team pages**
   - Lightweight scraping
   - Extract: name, title, bio, LinkedIn
3. **Client CSV uploads**
   - Events, conferences
   - Referrals, warm intros
   - Partner organizations (Jumpstart NJ, etc.)

---

## üèóÔ∏è New Architecture Components

### 1. Multi-Source Collection Layer

**Status**: New functionality

- Automated weekly scraping of public lists
- On-demand firm page scraping
- CSV upload interface with column mapping
- Source tracking and provenance

### 2. AI Verification Layer

**Status**: New functionality

- **"Same person?" validation**: Match records across sources
- **Source authority ranking**: Firm page (100) > Personal site (80) > Directory (60)
- **Confidence scoring**: 0-100 for each field
- **Conflict detection**: Flag when sources disagree

### 3. Human Review ("Data Inbox")

**Status**: New UI component needed

- Shows records needing review (`needs_review: true`)
- Side-by-side candidate comparison
- Quick approve/correct interface
- Tracks who verified what and when

### 4. Enhanced Database Schema

**Status**: Updated

- Verification fields (`verified`, `verification_confidence`, `needs_review`)
- Candidate storage (`email_candidates`, `linkedin_candidates`)
- Source tracking (`sources[]`, `primary_source`)
- Review history (`reviewed_by`, `reviewed_at`)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Migration Notes

### Existing Data

Current dashboard has 30 real prospects. Migration plan:

1. Add new fields with defaults:
   - `verified: false`
   - `verification_confidence: 0`
   - `needs_review: true`
   - `sources: [{type: "manual", name: "Initial Seed Data"}]`
2. Prompt admin to review all existing records
3. Once verified, set `verified: true`

### Breaking Changes

- None for frontend (new fields are additive)
- API responses include new fields (backward compatible)
- Filters work with existing prospects
